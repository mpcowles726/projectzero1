Cornerback Shareece Wright, who landed with the Ravens after asking for and getting his release from the 49ers, fell down on the play to leave Patton wide open and make for a lopsided return on the talent exchange between the two teams.",

Because not only did the Patriots quarterback enjoy his payback to the Colts for an offseason spent on #DeflateGate and a perfectly good cell phone, but he also added a chapter to the legend that he can flip a switch and drop this kind of performance as soon as heâ€™s offended."
